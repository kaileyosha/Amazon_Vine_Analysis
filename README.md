# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview 
This project required the use of ETL techniques to create a dataframe that allowed us to examine whether or not the amazon vine review program was an effective tool. 

## Summary
After processing the data that was extracted and transformed, we begin to see that the Amazon Vine program was not significantly more effective than standard word of mouth reviews were.
